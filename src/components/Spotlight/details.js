        question:
          "Q: Could you share what inspired you to pursue a career in consulting?",
        answer:
          "A: During my time at IIT Kharagpur, I was keen to explore various fields that might interest me and broaden my understanding. I dived into machine learning, AI, and project management, which all had their unique appeal. But as I progressed, I realized that my true passion lay in problem solving and making a tangible impact in real world scenarios. Consulting, with its dynamic nature and exposure to diverse industries, seemed like the ideal choice where I could apply my strengths. Additionally, I received great encouragement from my seniors, who saw my potential in consulting. Their guidance was instrumental in helping me envision a consulting career and ultimately join BCG’s Bangalore office. Consulting allows me to address complex challenges and make an impact across sectors, which is incredibly fulfilling.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "Q: How did you adapt your skills from an academic setting to a consulting role?",
        answer:
          "A: The transition from academics to consulting required significant flexibility and a commitment to continuous learning. My academic background laid the foundation of analytical skills, but I needed to translate that knowledge into practical, real world applications. Experiences in project work during college taught me to adapt my skills, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and industry demands. It was challenging to balance everything, but I managed by prioritizing tasks based on deadlines and their importance, ensuring that I stayed on top of my academic performance while also developing professional skills through internships and campus roles. Consulting demands a well rounded profile, where quick thinking and adaptability are essential. Broadening my perspective was key, and BCG’s supportive team environment made the steep learning curve much smoother. It wasn’t easy, but staying disciplined and open to learning made the transition rewarding.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "Q: What have been some of your most memorable experiences working at BCG?",
        answer:
          "A: My first project at BCG was quite memorable as it involved extensive data analysis and an intense amount of work on Excel. It was challenging at first, but my team’s support and guidance made a huge difference, helping me navigate this learning experience successfully. Another unforgettable project required me to interact with both factory workers and senior executives, providing me with exposure to different perspectives within an organization. A standout moment was presenting to a CEO within just six months of joining BCG — an experience that was both intimidating and deeply rewarding. Currently, I am working with public sector clients in South India, which has been a unique and invaluable experience. Each of these moments has been instrumental in building my confidence, teaching me client interaction skills, and allowing me to see the direct impact of our work.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "Q: What advice would you give to students aspiring to enter the consulting industry?",
        answer:
          "A: Consulting demands a well rounded skill set, which includes strong academics, relevant internships, and active involvement in extracurriculars. Excelling at multitasking and managing different stakeholders is crucial in this field. For me, the senior junior network at IIT Kharagpur was an invaluable resource, providing me with guidance and insight from people who had been through similar experiences. I strongly encourage students to reach out and engage with seniors, as their perspectives can be incredibly helpful in understanding the skills and mindset needed for consulting. Building relationships with mentors can provide both knowledge and encouragement. Consulting is a competitive field, but with discipline, focus, and the right support network, it’s achievable.",

      {
        question:
          "Q: How did your role as Vice President of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana help you develop as a leader?",
        answer:
          "A: Serving as Vice President taught me a great deal about responsibility and resilience. Being the first female VP came with its own set of challenges, as I encountered some initial skepticism about my ability to manage the role. However, I focused on proving myself by committing to my responsibilities and demonstrating my dedication to my duties. This role helped me develop confidence in my abilities, and I learned invaluable skills in team management and communication.. Through this role, I also learned to advocate for myself and others, paving the way for future female leaders on campus.",

      {
        question:
          "Q: Could you tell us about your role in campus reopening during the COVID 19 pandemic?",
        answer:
          "A: During the pandemic, I participated in a case study competition that focused on reopening IIT Kharagpur safely, an experience I found deeply rewarding. We aimed to revive important campus traditions like the Illumination and General Championship, even though we had to work within limited capacity due to health protocols. Seeing these events come to life was incredibly satisfying, as it allowed students to reconnect with campus life in a safe way. The experience underscored the importance of resilience, creativity, and teamwork. It wasn’t just about logistics — it was about bringing back the spirit of our campus, which had been missed by so many. Helping the student community reconnect after such a challenging period was one of my most fulfilling experiences.",

          "Q: As the first female VP of TSG, did you face any unique challenges, and how did you overcome them?",
        answer:
          "A: Being the first female VP of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana came with its own set of challenges. There was some initial skepticism and assumptions about my ability to manage the role, which was difficult at first. However, the support from the campus community made a big difference. I focused on proving myself by staying true to my responsibilities and consistently delivering results. Overcoming these challenges helped me build resilience and showed me the importance of confidence and focus. I hope that my experience can serve as an example to others, showing that leadership roles should be open to everyone, regardless of gender. This experience taught me that perseverance and hard work can break down barriers, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to pave the way for future female leaders.",

          "A: The IIT Kharagpur community played an integral role in my journey, contributing immensely to my personal and professional growth. The support and mentorship from my seniors were crucial. The senior junior culture at IIT Kharagpur fosters a strong sense of collaboration and encourages students to learn from each other’s experiences. This environment helped me build confidence, take on new challenges, and develop essential skills like time management and adaptability. The friendships and networks I built on campus are lifelong, and the skills I honed in this community have been invaluable in consulting, where collaboration and adaptability are paramount.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "Q: What key advice would you like to share with juniors and incoming students?",
        answer:
          "A: My advice is to make the most of your time in college by exploring various fields and opportunities. Don’t limit yourself — try different things, connect with seniors, and embrace what you’re passionate about. A career in consulting, or any problem solving field, requires you to think creatively and continuously build diverse skills. College is the best time to step out of your comfort zone, as these years are invaluable for growth and self discovery. Take advantage of the resources and opportunities around you; they’ll shape you in ways you might not realize now. Consulting or not, these experiences will help you, no matter where your career takes you.",
